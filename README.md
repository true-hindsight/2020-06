**Gullibility and amnesia makes the world economy go round and round!** 

- I have come to realize this with respect to the following investigations and views concerning human behavior and industrial supply chain economics.

  In Nov-Dec 2019 I had forecasted an economic meltdown in North America worse than The Great Depression of 1928-1938. This was in lieu of evidence I had about: 
    - Carillion's domino effect on public sector companies of UK, Canada and US from July 2018 coupled with 
    - GM Oshawa Plant shutting down and 
    - Receivership data from Deloitte Canada. 
  
    The most interesting aspect of the [Carillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carillion) data was that companies like [Canadian Linen & Uniform Services](https://www.canadianlinen.com/) (CL&US) had copied Carillion's business model and financial networking (read as manipulation) techniques. One strategy was to get in bed with Canadian civil services while dawning the "costume of a private French maid." The company's somewhat private and somewhat Francophone bosses maintained a roster of clients that were mainly in private healthcare, long-term care and hospitality sector apart from the public companies. By straddling the private/public grey area the company continued to amass wealth for its investors. Like Carillion, CL&US improved its client base and upper margins through networking among elite financial analysts and investors by showing them "impeccable quality of accounts receivables" of public companies. And it lowered its bottom line by consistently pushing employees to settle for minimum wages in tough working conditions without appropriate unionization and by cutting costs for better employee training and better quality equipment. 
    
    The LIBOR banks chopped up Carillion in Q1 2018 after it came to light that most of its public and private sector clients had no means of paying the years of uncollected debt that had been carried on its books. The debt was far too over-leverged and the company collapsed exposing the soiled underbelly of similar companies across UK, Canada and US. So what did the banks do? They doubled down on this and forced austerity measures on their debtors (poor Oh Canada) while conveniently manipulating daily CAD-GBP rates throughout 2018. The effect of currency manipulation is discussed a little later.  
    
    By end of Q1 2019 the GM Oshawa Plant in Ontario had finally shut down most of its operations and had gotten rid of almost all of its employees. It is not easy to shut down an auto assembly plant the size of GM Oshawa. When I interviewed people in Oshawa who were employees and family members of employees I came across a startling view. For many people from Oshawa to Ajax, it was accepted that the plant was past its defunct status and should have been shut down in mid 2000s. The network effect of the GM Oshawa Plant collapse rippled through heavy industry sector in Ontario. By Q2 2019 another major debacle in automotives with Bombardier's woes were echoing through financial meetings of every precision manufacturing vendor in Ontario. 
    
    So how was the retail and entrepreneurial scene holding up in Q2 2019? Given that the Canadian: 
      - civil services sector and its network of supply chain was already on the chopping board due to austerity measures and poor business model copied from Carillion 
      - heavy manufacturing and precision manufacturing sectors were taking a nose dive even with deals like Dassault's support for Bombardier coming into play
      
    The Canadian retail and entrepreneurial scene was worse than *maggot infested dog shit* in Q2 2019! Macy's and the likes had already folded their operations and liquidated their inventories in malls of tier-two cities like Kitchener-Waterloo. The likes of Nordstrom, GAP and Forever21 were struggling to generate revenues in tier-one cities like Toronto. The startup scene was preoccupied with nonsense about "pushing the limits" of artificial intelligence (AI), augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) even though none of the existing x86 chipsets used by such startups could possibly support the day dreams of entrepreneurs. These Canadian startups kept taking on massive debt from US investors. Additionally, an increasing number of large and medium-sized Canadian companies were going into receivership between March 2019 and Sept 2019 as per Deloitte's publicly available data. However, their assets were not being picked up by other small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as noted from the same data set. This indicated that either 
      - the SMEs did not have liquidity to buy even 10 cents to the dollar worth of amazingly valuable fixed assets and intellectual properties (IPs) or 
      - these amazingly valuable assets were truly obsolete and weren't worth picking up at even 1/10th the original price from the banks that repossessed them. 
      
    So how were these banks going to recuperate their debt? 
    
    Strangely, when a Canadian company looks for liquidity it almost always goes south of the border to the US and tries to convert USD to CAD using debt instruments like call options and loans. The Canadian dollar is practically pegged to US dollar with 1 USD = 0.75 CAD (approx). But, and this is a big but, the Trump administration has been pushing for a stronger USD against: 
      - GPB, forcing value of 1 USD towards 0.75 GBP from 0.9 GBP and 
      - EUR, forcing value of 1 USD towards 1 EUR from 1.3 EUR
      
    In doing so, the US has been signaling to the global forex markets that when it comes to contract settlements and international trade, it is on par with EU and that the world ought to treat the UK the way it treats Canada (basicaly ignore UK like Canada). The Brexit trainwreck and LIBOR lending rates manipulations did delegitimise the influence of London on global markets. However, I would say that the unwealdy ogre called UK is definitely more capable in supporting the British Pound than Canada can support the Canadian Dollar. I would also posit that comparison of US standards with that of EU is tough but in general EU standards and their implementation are still better than that of US and especially Canada when it comes to 
      - quality of life, 
      - per capita income, 
      - ecological development, 
      - public infrastructure modernization, 
      - handling of human rights particularly for refugees,
      - privacy and security and 
      - financial management. 
    
    So what's the point of signaling to the global markets that US currency and underlying norms are more worthwhile than any other ones even though the US manaically thrashed its FDA, EPA and intelligence agencies in Q4 2017 after sounding the war bugle against Russia and China? In addition to bashing their key federal agencies US has been bleeding profusely because of The Boeing Company. Boeing's 737 fleet had been grounded across the world for faulty software and Boeing was under investigation for knowingly hiding facts about problems with its manufacturing and maintainance of 737s. 
    
    Due to all these facts, I beleive the current North American trade and diplomatic values are merely propped up by posturing for the sake of propagation a useless MAGA agenda of the misguided Trump administration. The current US administration simply doesn't understand how buying international favour and influence with a weaker USD and the supply of foreign aid to various key natiions works. The type of currency manipulations practiced in Americas most tragicly impact submissive countries like Canada. To shoreup the US petrodollar, Canada has to pay in USD to pipe crude oil from Alberta-to-Texas and then pay a whole lot more, again in USD, to pipe refined petroleum products from Texas-to-Ontario. While doing so, Canada is also forced to purchase substandard products from US via corporations like Wallmart at the cost of an underdeveloped local food and beverages industry. Due to this, there is still no such thing as "Canadian Cousine" to found in any media. 
    
    Such is the deplorable S&M relationship between the US and Canada where Canada has been the masochist since World War I. The war bonds peddled by [The Dominion Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dominion_Bank) in 1917 invariably chained Canada to US millitary ambitions. The Canadian food, drugs and restaurant industry in particular has remained subservient to the whims of entities like *John Hancock - Manulife Corp.* which get to gouge these industries via insurance rate manipulations and by renegging on insurance policy payouts.      
    
    All these industry markers warned analysits across the world of an economic freefall but the US, UK, Singapore and Hong Kong stock markets kept ginning up the idea of a bullet proof economyy! They cited the growing sales revenues of tech giants for a bull market. This was of course complete bullshit and was just a ploy to swindle middle-class investors and pension funds! The global debt cycle had begun in Q1 2017 and was predicted to reach its trough in Q3 2019. Every economist worth their salt posted articles that the quantitative easing measures from 2012 had encouraged bad lending and that a situation worse than the 2008-2010 recession was in store for the global economy. Knowing all this, US and UK lenders called to redeem 5, 10, 20 and 50 year bonds simultaneously in Q4 2019 and Q1 2020. They knew that this would slash and burn the "weaker nations" and scuttle most public sector corporations. In line with these predictions HSBC decided to lay off 35,000 employees by the end of Q3 2019. And around that time, in Oct 2019, is when I first started to notice back channel reports and cables about biochemical warfare brewing between Hong Kong and mainland China. It would be an entire 4 month cycle before appropriate measures would even be acknowledged in Canada about the Covid pandemic that sprung out of a full fledged biochemical and cybernetic war.
